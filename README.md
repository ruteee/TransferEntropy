# TransferEntropy
Python Implementation of Transfer Entropy Method

Contains a Python implementation of the Transfer Entropy method proposed by Schreiber(2000).

In this repository are also available a notebook with an implemetation of graph visualization using Graphviz and a notebook with a function to filter valid values of transfer entropy based on a treshold.
